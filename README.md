# unit-4-game

## Summary: The purpose of this assignment was to get practical experience with jQuery, and to use some of the many methods that are included within the jQuery library. Overall I feel like I did better on this assignment than I did last week, but there were a couple of areas that tripped me up. While I can assign a random value to a click, I don't know how I can save that click and apply it's value each time the same crystal button is clicked. I also tried out code to add the random number of each crystal to an overall sum but it broke my code. Please see my psudo-coding for more on this and how the game should map out.

## Steps:

1. First, I wrote the HTML and tags for the elements
2. I used CSS in a separate sheet to style the page. 
3. I applied the jQuery CDN on the index.html page to link it to the game.js page. 
4. I looked at the lotto generator excercise as a major reference for setting up random numbers. 
5. I set each crystal button to spit out a randomly generated number from the array length + 1.
6. I set up the wins and losses conditional statements to incremental either the losses or wins score.
